# JAMS
> JAMS Auto-Mute Sometimes

JAMS pause your music when you're watching a video on your browser.

## Why?
This is a rewrite of an old bash script I had, I'm no bash fan and I didn't like working on it but at least it got the job done for a while.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevimmu/jams
cd jams
pipx install .
```
